## Installing Dependencies
Installing GeoPandas can be a little tricky; if you have any issues related to dependencies, please see [this page](https://cacarer.com/tip/installing-geopandas-with-its-dependencies-without-installing-microsoft-visual-c/) for further instructions.

The other packages imported in the notebook can be installed with `pip install packageName` (assuming path variable settings are correct).
